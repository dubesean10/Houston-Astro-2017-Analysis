# Houston-Astro-2017-Analysis

Our study focuses on the 2017 MLB postseason, and more specifically, the differences in the statistics in home and away games, between the Houston Astros and the other nine teams that competed in the postseason that year. For more background information as to why we are so interested in this specific topic, the Houston Astros were caught cheating during the postseason in 2017. The Astros were doing something known as sign stealing, and were using cameras in center field to film the opposing teamâ€™s catcher giving specific signs to the pitcher. Members of the Astros organization, both staff and players, would watch the live feed, then signal to the batter which pitch to expect. Obviously, this gives the Houston Astros a huge advantage at home. The Houston Astros went on to win the 2017 World Series.

As for our research questions, we hope to answer the following: 
Is there a clear difference between the home and away statistics when we just focus on the Houston Astros? 
And how do the Houston Astros home and away statistics compare to the other postseason teams' home and away stats? 

We used data from MLB.com to help answer these questions.
